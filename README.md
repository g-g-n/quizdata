# MCQ Program

Goal is to write a program which runs from command prompt and presents one question to the user at a time from the json. 
Prints the possible answers for that question and allows user to pick one of them (a, b, c, d). Like MCQ.
Shows if the picked option is right or wrong. At the end of the program prints the over all score too.

Here is the json file which contains 2 questions with possible and correct answer.
Increase the questions to 5-6 atleast by adding more to the json file.

Give me a git repo url of the code written. Along with a README.md in the repo.
I will clone the repo and run the program and I expect it to run smoothly.
